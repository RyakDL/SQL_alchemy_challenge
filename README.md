# SQL_alchemy_challenge
Module 10 homework

Overall comment: SQL alchemy is a very powerful tool and SQL lite files are great way to share databases outside of a SQL server. My familarity with Pandas helped me reinforce my SQL skills. The API part of the homework was very interesting to learn and a new way to display database information and create queries. I beleive these skills will come in handy in my future as I pursue a career as a data scientist focused in finance. 

Instuctions: 
1) Open the climate_starter.ipynb file in Pandas. Run the kernal. 

2) The Climate_app.py file can be opened and run in VS Code (where I created it) or more simply run in the Terminal (or Git Bash). Copy and paste the http address into a Chrome browser to enteract with the data.
